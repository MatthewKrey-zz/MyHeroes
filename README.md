# Working with Social Graphs w/ Python 

Data Science Experiment 2 

**Heroic_Social_Network_Tinkering.py** is *Work in Progress*

*Began with* **Social_Graphing_BabySteps.py** *to experiment with graphing social networks.*

Project Goals: 

1) Importing, Preparing, Exploring Social Networks in Python

2) Finding strong ties between individuals in a social network 

3) Finding key (or central) individuals in a social network 

4) Explore characteristics of entire social networks 

5) Clustering and community detection in social networks using Centrality Algorithms 

6) Visualizing Social Graphs
